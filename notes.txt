            App - Top Level
        /                 \
    ItemsList          Individual Item  
    / 
 Item                  


1. Make a new component
2. Tested if connected to appjs
3. in app js made a new state for tracking state of individual item in order to show
4. passed setter through props to itemslist 
5. passed individual item props to individual item component render in app js
6. TO DO : Use the setter in onclick
7. item we click on is to be displayed, so we pass it into setter in item js
8. since we pass it in in app js, 



notes from review:

change line 19 in app js to response without .json
and routes items js line 12 to res.json
